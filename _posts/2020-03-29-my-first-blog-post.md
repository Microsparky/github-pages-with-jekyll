# First Post: Learning About USB

Well here it is my first blog post... lets talk USB

# The Fear of USB
Many engineers have a fear of implementing USB 2.0, 
I dont share that fear and consequently I think everything should have a USB port, 
even my prototype development boards!

Why do hardware and firmware engineers alike fear USB?
- High speed differential signals?
- Complex system architecture?
- Complex protocol?
- Device class and discriptor?
- USB compliance testing

My guess is that they have never looked into it and the fear is just a fear of the unknown! 
There is certainly a rational argument to not use USB over somthing like UART, 
it is more complex so if you dont need the bandwith why bother learning a new complex protocol 
and adding extra compliance hurdles to the project you will probably crash and burn!
